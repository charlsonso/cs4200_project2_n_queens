Examples of successful outputs are in the file sa_metrics.txt and genetic_algo_metrics.txt

Simulated Annealing
-------------------
1. Navigate to the simulated_annealing directory
2. If you wish to compile the code, navigate to src/ and type in your console with java sdk 8
```javac Board.java SA.java SARunner.java```
3. In the folder with the compiled binary run simulated annealing by typing
```java SARunner```
This should be done either in the src folder where you have compiled the code or simply run the command in the bin directory.

Genetic Algorithm
----------------
1. Navigate to genetic_algorithm directory.
2. If you wish to compile the code, navigate to src/ and type in your console with java sdk 8
```javac GeneticRunner.java Genetic.java Board.java```
3. In the folder with the compiled binary run the genetic algorithm by typing
```java GeneticRunner```
This should be done either in the src folder where you have compiled the code or simply run the command in the bin directory.

Note: The algorithm is run three times on different initial states and may take a while to complete.
